	//to know where they located in the interfaces
	//I got it as a hint from someone took the course before
	//same as mentioned in "Save.cpp" file


	GUI* pGUI = pControl->GetUI();
	Graph* pGraph = pControl->getGraph();

	//after i told where my pointer GUI and Graph points, I will applay the delete function 

	pControl->deleteallshapes(); //this function will loop on all the shapes saved in the array and delete them
	pGUI->PrintMessage("Done deleted the shape. "); //I see these massages are very important to check if the could good run or not while traying
